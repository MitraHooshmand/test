            The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an
            information system where documents and other web resources are
            identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as
            https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and
            are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are
            transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be
            accessed by users by a software application called a web browser,
            and are published by a software application called a web server. The
            World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated
            the Web in some form by over two decades and upon the technologies
