            <br />
            A Persian carpet (Persian: فرش ايرانى‎, romanized: farš-e irâni
            [ˈfærʃe ʔiːɾɒːˈniː]) or Persian rug (Persian: قالی ايرانى‎,
            romanized: qâli-ye irâni [ɢɒːˈliːje ʔiːɾɒːˈniː]),[1] also known as
            Iranian carpet, is a heavy textile made for a wide variety of
            utilitarian and symbolic purposes and produced in Iran (historically
            known as Persia), for home use, local sale, and export. Carpet
            weaving is an essential part of Persian culture and Iranian art.
            Within the group of Oriental rugs produced by the countries of the
            "rug belt", the Persian carpet stands out by the variety and
            elaborateness of its manifold designs.
